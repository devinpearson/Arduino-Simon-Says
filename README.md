# Arduino-Simon-Says

This arduino project is based upon the work done by faziefazie.
His instructions for building the arduino code and are available here:
    http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Simple-Simon-Says-Game/
    
This was based upon an original sketch by Robert Spann in 2009, and as publicised on mpilchfamily's instructables.

His published code (written with an earlier version of the Arduino software) required the manual introduction of a tone library. 
Later versions of the Arduino code base now include a tone library by default. However, they require an additional pitches.h file to be created. 
This repository includes both of these in the same location and cleanly compiles.

Hope that you find it useful.
