# Arduino-Simon-Says

This arduino project is based upon the work done by faziefazie.
His instructions for building the arduino code and are available here:
    http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Simple-Simon-Says-Game/
  
His published code (written with an earlier version of the Arduino software) required the manual introduction of a tone library. 
Later versions of the Arduino code base now include the tone library by default. However, they require an additional pitches.h file to be created. 
This repository includes both of these in the same location and could be taken as is.

Hope that you find it useful.
